Overview

A remake the popular 1984 shooter game DuckHunt.  The objective of the game is to shoot ducks and accrue as many points as possible.

Ducks appear one at a time and the player is granted 3 shots to shoot down the duck. The player must shoot 6+ ducks to advance to the next round.  Failure to do so will result in a game over.  With each subsequent round, ducks will increase in speed and be worth more points when shot.
